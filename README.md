# No RL No Simulation (NRNS)
Official implementation of the NRNS paper: No RL, No Simulation: Learning to Navigate without Navigating

NRNS is a heriarchical modular approach to image goal navigation that uses a topological map and distance estimator to navigate and self-localize. Distance function and target prediction function are learnt over passive video trajectories gathered from Mp3D and Gibson.
